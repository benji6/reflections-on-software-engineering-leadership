# What is the job of a software engineering leader?

In the broadest and simplest terms you're hired to make money for the business.

If you're a leader in the software engineering field you are responsible for building, maintaining and operating the business's software products with a view to growing revenue, improving margins.

First you need to define (or help define if you have a peer in Product) a product strategy and to define a technology strategy. These strategies are designed to maximize profit for the business given all the opportunities and constraints you are faced with.

Once that is in place you can execute on your strategies by:

- Embodying the culture of the organization you wish to lead
- Ensuring an effective organizational design. This means having the right structure, which would usually be a flat hierrarchy with autonomous (i.e. loosely coupled, highly cohesive) teams. It also means having the right people in those roles.
- Amplifying talent density by managing inflows (e.g. hiring) and outflows (e.g. layoffs & churn) of people
- Defining processes (e.g. lean software engineering, hiring funnels, post-mortems etc) such that the organization has the appropriate level of guidance and governance and can deliver good results at pace
- Leveraging the management chain, documentation and appropriate communication channels to build a culture that reinforces optimal behavior
- Using tooling to technically control for optimal behavior where appropriate

In general you want to ensure you can deliver a high throughput of value at short lead times in a predictable manner. Theory of constraints, lean software engineering and the 3 ways of DevOps are your friends here.
