# What is the job of a software engineering leader?

In the broadest and simplest terms you're hired to make money for the business.

If you're a leader in the software engineering field you are responsible for building, maintaining and operating the business's software products with a view to growing revenue and profit. This applies at all levels: executive, middle manager and line manager.

If you are the most senior leader you must first define (or help define if you have a peer in Product) a product strategy and an engineering strategy. These strategies are designed to maximize profit for the business through competitive advantage given all the opportunities and constraints you are faced with. There is plenty of fantastic literature on strategy out there, I would recommend [Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy) and [Understanding Michael Porter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13263934-understanding-michael-porter) in particular.

Once that is in place the rest is execution. You are accountable for maximizing the effectiveness with which you execute against the strategy. Usually, within Engineering, this translates as maximizing the throughput of value whilst minimizing time to market (lead times). Sometimes predictability of delivery is important too. There are a lot of tools you can lean on:

- Embodying and engendering the culture of the organization you wish to lead. Culture cascades down the organization so leverage this with your direct reports.
- Using policy and process to organize and guide people within the team. Use technical controls wherever possible, and if not possible then use formal documentation and enforce it. Examples include your change management process, your SDLC, your incident management and post-mortem processes and your performance review process.
- Amplifying talent density. You manage inflows by designing, implementing and iterating on an effective hiring process. You increase talent density of your team through effective growth and performance management. You manage outflows by retaining highly talented team members and managing low performers out of the team.
- Ensuring an effective organizational design. Your strategy instructs how your team should be applied and therefore informs how it should best be structured. You need a clear hierarchy that is not too flat (typically no one should have more than 10 direct reports) and not too flat (typically no one should have fewer than 3 direct reports). Decisions should be pushed down the hierarchy as far as they can effectively go ensuring that teams are empowered, autonomous and accountable. Teams need to have clearly delineated responsibilities (i.e. loosely coupled, highly cohesive) to minimize friction. The people should fit the structure and the roles and you should not try to fit structure and roles around your existing team.
- Using theory of constraints, lean software engineering and the 3 ways of DevOps to optimize the throughput and minimize the lead times of your value stream.
- Leveraging technical architecture to optmize for team performance

Much of your time will be spent on tactical and operational concerns, but these more strategic elements give you the leverage to be truly effective in your role.
