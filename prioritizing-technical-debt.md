# Prioritizing technical debt

## How to prioritize

The principal criterion for prioritizing tech debt is the same as the principal criterion for any type of investment - what will make the most money?

Security work is valuable because it mitigates potential lost revenue in the case that something goes wrong in the future.

Elasticity and performance improvements save costs (and therefore improve profits) in future.

Increasing automation, reducing toil, improving the efficiency of pipelines - these sorts of changes pay off by freeing up the team's time so they can generate more revenue in the future.

Improvements that boost developer efficiency (e.g. keeping documentation, dependencies and tooling up-to-date) also create more capacity for the team to generate more revenue for the business in the future.

## Failure modes

Under-investment in tech debt prioritizes short-term goals over the long-term ones. This can be done under exceptional circumstances for short periods of time, but generally it is a poor management decision to do this long-term.

Investment in tech debt carries an opportunity cost (developing revenue generating features, or cost-saving enhancements) and if the opportunity cost is higher than the ROI from the tech debt investment then the investment in tech debt should not be made. It is possible to over-invest in tech debt (e.g. https://xkcd.com/1205)

There is another failure mode where the team invests in technical projects that do not yield any improvements in cost-efficiency or development capacity (e.g. migrating to a new framework due to perceived benefits that are never realized).
