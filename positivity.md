# Positivity

As a leader you spin the narratives that explain and organize the information in your company, we covered this in [facts and stories](facts-and-stories.md). But you also set the tone for these narratives. Almost every group of facts can either be described with a positive narrative or a negative one, just like the proverbial glass half full/empty.

I recall a time when a line manager who reported into me quit, I saw this as a problem and my manager described it to me as an opportunity. There is truth in adages like "every cloud has a silver lining" and "when one door closes another opens". As a leader it's your responsibility to present the facts as they are and with integrity, but it's also your responsibility to define how the team should interpret these facts and respond to them. You set the tone and you can make a conscious choice to spin things either positively or negatively. Typically the former is better for the team's morale and motivation.

We spend a huge chunk of our waking lives at work so we might as well enjoy it. Positive teams are also more productive and productivity feels glood. Our emotions drive our actions and have a way of self-reinforcing.

Your attitude is contagious, especially as a leader. Consider how to use this knowledge wisely.
