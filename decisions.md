# Decisions

Making decisions is an essential component of leadership. Making good decisions is hard and is a differentiator between good leaders and bad ones.

You will never have all the information required to make an optimal decision. You are not able to anticipate all the potential consequences of any decision you make. However, there is sometimes information available in the present that can help rule out certain options or make others obviously favorable. Therefore, when struggling to make a decision first ask yourself if there is any more information you can gather to make a solution more obvious.

Delaying decisions until the point where they need to be made allows for flexibility. Delaying decisions beyond the point where it is optimal to make them is bad leadership.

Sometimes a sufficiently detailed description of a situation makes the optimal decision obvious. The rest of the time though, you're on your own :)
