# Bravery

Wisdom without bravery is useless.

The needs of your team are usually closely aligned with the needs of the wider business. So, when your team's needs are being threatened and encroached upon, your obligation to your team and the wider business is to stand up for them. It takes wisdom to know what is right and wrong and how best to get the results you need. It takes bravery to actually do it.

If you do not stand up for your team then they will lose trust in you. If you prioritize the team over the business or act too aggressively this will undermine the trust you have with your peers and superiors. In either case the effectiveness of the organization suffers.

Rarely the needs of your team are not aligned with the wider business. It takes wisdom to realize that and bravery to make a sacrifice for the greater good.

Bravery is an essential quality in a software enginering leader and I've seen teams fail when it has been absent.
