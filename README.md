# Reflections on software engineering leadership

## What

This is a place to keep my reflections on software engineering leadership.

## Why

I lead teams of software engineers and I find reflecting on the subject can really help clarify what my role is, what the purpose of my role is, and how to be effective in my role. Ultimately I find that taking time to reflect on what I do makes me better at actually doing it.

I'm making these reflections public on the basis that if they are useful to me then they may be useful to others too.
