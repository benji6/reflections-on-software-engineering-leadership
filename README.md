# Reflections on software engineering leadership

## What

This is a place to keep my reflections on software engineering leadership.

If you're interested in seeing when new reflections are added then feel free to watch the repo.

## Why

I lead teams of software engineers and I find reflecting on the subject can really help clarify what my role is, what the purpose of my role is, and how to be effective in my role. Ultimately I find that taking time to reflect on what I do makes me better at actually doing it.

I'm making these reflections public on the basis that if they are useful to me then they may be useful to others too.

If you do find anything useful here then starring the repo would be a great way of letting me know. Furthermore, feel welcome to raise an issue if you have any other feedback.
