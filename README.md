# Reflections on software engineering leadership

## What

This is a place to keep my reflections on software engineering leadership.

If you're interested in seeing when new reflections are added then feel free to watch the repo.

## Why

I lead teams of software engineers and I find reflecting on the subject can help clarify the purpose of my role and how to be effective in it. Ultimately, I find that taking time to reflect on what I do makes me better at actually doing it.

I'm making these reflections public because it drives a level of quality that might not exist if I kept them private.

I think it's unlikely that anyone else will find these reflections useful and that is not the main driving force behind me writing them. However, if you do find anything useful here then give me a star or write an issue. All feedback welcome.
