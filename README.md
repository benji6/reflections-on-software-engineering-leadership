# Reflections on software engineering leadership

## What

This is a place to keep my reflections on software engineering leadership.

## Why

I lead teams of software engineers and I find reflecting on the subject can help clarify the purpose of my role and how to be effective in it. Ultimately, I find that taking time to reflect on what I do makes me better at actually doing it.

These reflections are primarily for myself, but I make them public to drive a higher level of quality. I think it's unlikely that anyone else will find these reflections useful, however, if you do find anything useful here then give me a star or write an issue. All feedback welcome.

## How

If you're interested in seeing when new reflections are added you can watch the repo.
