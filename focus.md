# Focus

Strategizing is of limited value without execution. Execution is extremely difficult without focus. Focus requires two things. Firstly, it requires that you constantly remind people of what is important, measuring them on it and holding them accountable for it. Secondly it requires saying no to everything that you should not be focussing on yet. If you do not free up capacity in your team to focus on what is of highest importance you risk failing to execute.

Value from engineering projects is typically only unlocked once the project is complete. As per lean software engineering philosophy we should seek to minimize work in progress and finish high priority projects before engaging new ones. As a leader your responsibility is to ensure your team is aligned on what is of the highest value and it is your responsibility to shield them from anything else.

That is focus, the key to execution.
