# Facts and stories

There are facts and there are stories.

Without stories facts are just arbitrary data points, neither good or bad in and of themselves. Without facts that back them up stories are not compelling and any story that does not fit the facts is easily dismissed.

I believe a big part of leading and motivating people lies in creating compelling stories that are backed up by hard facts that unify people behind a common purpose and motivate them to action.
