# On impact

Today there is a trend for evaluating performance based on impact. There are several inputs that feed into impact and a pretty large one happens to be pure luck. There are several historical examples of people who have achieved great things by chance and people who have been execptionally talented and ended up failing (e.g. Hannibal).

Impact is extremely important, but it is a mistake to view it as the most important way of evaluating performance.
