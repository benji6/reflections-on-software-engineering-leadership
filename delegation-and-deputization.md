# Delegation and deputization

Countless reams have been written on delegation so I won't spend much time on that, suffice to say that you cannot possibly do everything a whole team can do, so in order to be as effective as possible as a leader, you must be willing to delegate and you must be effective at it.

Something I would like to add to the conversation though is the importance of deputization. Organizational resilience is all too often overlooked and deprioritized, but for every manager in an ideal organization there should be someone who can be deputized into that role. In this way the organization can handle minor shocks like PTO and sick leave, but also it can be resilient to larger shocks like people leaving.

This of course also helps build the skills and careers of those who step up to deputize for their managers. It is good for managers, their deputies, their own managers and their teams.

An ideal organization should have no key people.
