# Delegation and deputization

Countless reams have been written on delegation so I won't spend much time on that, suffice to say that you cannot possibly do everything a whole team can do, so in order to be as effective as possible as a leader, you must be willing to delegate and you must be effective at it.

Something I would like to add to the conversation though is the importance of deputization. Organizational resilience is all too often overlooked and deprioritized, but for every manager in an ideal organization there should be someone who can be deputized into that role. In this way the organization can handle minor shocks like PTO and sick leave, but also it can be resilient to larger shocks like people leaving.

When considering minor shocks like PTO and sick leave, it's detrimental to organizational resilience if the employee in question continues to conduct part of their job (e.g. responding to emails and messages) while on leave. The more strictly leave is enforced, the better it is for organizational resilience. It is also better for the people taking that leave (consider the element of personal resilience that comes with taking a break and refreshing).

When considering the employees who deputize for their managers, it is clear that this process builds their skills and develops their careers. This is good for them and good for the organization.

An ideal organization should have no key people.
