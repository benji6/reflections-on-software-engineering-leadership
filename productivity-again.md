# Productivity again

More thoughts on this topic.

## Thought 1

Imagine you hire a team to build a house and they complete it in 2 years. Was that team productive? Another team builds a house in 1 year, were they productive? Maybe we could measure how many bricks they lay per day, but what if one of the houses is mostly made of concrete? Maybe we can measure how long they spend on site? Clearly there is such a colossal amount of context required in evaluating the productivity of the 2 teams about the work they are doing and the composition of the team that there is no single measure that will give you an accurate view on their productivity. But, the fact remains that productivity is important and you want your house to be built efficiently.

## Thought 2

Productivity is not the most important aspect of an engineering team and it also isn't in any way foundational. It is a secondary effect that emerges from the conditions that you set as the leader of the Engineering org.

Once you have the strategy down, the correct org structure in place, the right talent density and the right culture then you will naturally have a very high productivity off the back of that. It's not possible to have all those preconditions and to have an unproductive team. Incidentally, I see technical architecture as dependent on the preconditions I have listed here too, but it also feeds into productivity.

This doesn't solve the problem of measuring productivity, but it does bypass it. If we can be confident that laying the right preconditions will lead to optimal productivity then we really only need to concern ourselves with all the preconditions. Any attept to measure productivity thereafter is just a curiosity and doesn't hold any business use.

However, keeping on top of business outcomes is always important. Teams must be relentlessly focussed on driving the most business value they possibly can, rather than optimizing for productivity.
