# Parkinson's law

[Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) states that work expands to fill the time available.

What are the mechanics behind this? I can think of 4:

- Team is lazy and does not work as hard as they should because they have too much time
  - In this case you have a culture/talent problem that you can address through performance management, layoffs and hiring.
- Timelines are artificially inflated to protect the team from negative repercussions if timelines are missed
  - You have a psychological safety problem in your org and probably are operating on a poor understanding of how to estimate projects.
- Scope creep. If there is too much time available the team may add scope that may or may not add value. Perhaps scope was never well-defined in the first place
  - In this case you need to define scope upfront and manage delivery so the team does not get distracted by low value work.
- Competing priorities. [As we know](littles-law.md), lead times lengthen when the team has more work than it can effectively parallelize. If a team has multiple deadlines for multiple workstreams then it will use slack in some workstreams to accelerate workstreams that have less slack - this is logical and correct behavior given the constraints management is applying to the team.
  - If you want shorter lead times you must limit work in progress aggressively and set clear priorities. The team has fixed capacity and if you try to fit more work into that capacity than is possible then lead times will lengthen.

If you:

- Have a talented and motivated team
- Have psychological safety and a high-trust organization
- Set scope clearly upfront
- Make commitments based on reliable bottom-up estimates
- Limit work in progress and ruthlessly prioritize

Then you will not have any problems with Parkinson's law.
