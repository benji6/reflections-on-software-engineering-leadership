# On leadership

Here are some notes on what leadership means to me and how I believe successful leaders operate.

## What does effective leadership look like?

The best way to determine the effectiveness of a leader is to ask to what degree their team as a whole operates as more than just the sum of its individuals. Strong leadership drives disproportionate improvements in outcomes, whereas poor leadership can easily result in a whole that is less than the sum of its parts.

## How do effective leaders operate?

Effective leaders motivate and inspire. They set a compelling vision that gives everyone a sense of meaning and a shared purpose.

Effective leaders build and organize teams that combine individuals with a diverse range of experience and abilities into a single unit that achieves far greater things than any member could alone.

Effective leaders are capable of operating successfully on both the strategic and tactical levels. They maintain a high-level of situational awareness, always mindful and supportive of the people in their team and always mindful and aware of the environment in which they are operating. The world both outside and inside the team are in constant flux and thus require constant attention.

Effective leaders ensure that everyone succeeds in their shared purpose together.
