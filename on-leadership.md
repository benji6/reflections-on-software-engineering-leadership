# On leadership

Here are some notes on what leadership means to me and how I believe successful leaders operate.

## What does effective leadership look like?

The best way to determine the effectiveness of a leader is to ask to what degree their team as a whole operates as more than just the sum of its individuals. Strong leadership drives disproportionate improvements in outcomes, whereas poor leadership can easily result in a whole that is less than the sum of its parts.

## The core components of leadership

1. **Vision**: As a leader you must set a compelling view of the future that is inspiring and motivating and gives everyone a sense of meaning and a shared purpose.
2. **Strategy**: As a leader you must be clear about how the team will attain the vision - this means being explicit about what the team will and will not do in order to get there.
3. **Policy and process**: As a leader you must put in place policies and processes that enable the team to execute the strategy as effectively as possible.
4. **Culture & values**: As a leader you are responsible for the culture of your team. Culture is the invisible stuff that fills in all the gaps where process doesn't dictate explicit behavior. It glues the team into one cohesive whole where every member instinctively knows how to act even when things are ambiguous or when there is a lack of explicit direction. It manifests across the team as a coherent and effective approach to autonomy.

## How do effective leaders operate?

An effective leader understands how essential it is to have the right people in a team and will do what is necessary (through effective hiring, retaining and letting go) to ensure that talent density is high.

Effective leaders know how to structure teams ensuring they can act with high degrees of autonomy to achieve their goals.

Effective leaders have no problem operating at the operational and tactical levels, but will always prioritize the strategic level. When operating tactically they make clear decisions, hold people accountable and celebrate the team's successes. They maintain a high-level of situational awareness, always mindful and supportive of the people in their team and always mindful and aware of the environment in which they are operating.

It takes a long time to shape a really effective team and the work is never truly done. The world both outside and inside the team are in constant flux and thus effective leaders must pay constant attention and adapt when necessary.

Effective leaders are able to derive a sense of reward and pleasure from their work and sustain themselves through what can be incredibly taxing and high-pressure work.

Effective leaders ensure that everyone succeeds in their shared purpose together.
